# Problem Description

The traffic light controller is used for the intersection of a main road, and a secondary, which leads to a depot of trucks dedicated to transport special. The priority is given to secondary road. There is a sensor on the secondary road to detect the presence of a vehicle. If it's thus, the traffic light on the main street becomes YELLOW, then RED so that the vehicles from the secondary road they can cross the main road. Otherwise, the traffic light on the main road it is always GREEN and the traffic light on the secondary road is always RED. The time period is 3 time units for the YELLOW light and 10 time units for the Red light.
